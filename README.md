Supervised learning-based path planning system for autonomous vehicles using Random Forest
# ðŸš— Path Planning in Autonomous Vehicles using Supervised Learning

This project demonstrates a supervised learning approach for path planning in autonomous vehicles. Inspired by traditional algorithms like RRT* and Artificial Potential Fields (APF), this implementation uses a machine learning model to predict vehicle movement decisions (e.g., LEFT, RIGHT, FORWARD, STOP) based on environmental features.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To develop a machine learning model using the Random Forest Classifier that accurately predicts the vehicle's next move based on current state and surroundings like obstacle proximity, lane position, velocity, road type, etc.


ðŸ“Š Dataset Details

A synthetic dataset was generated with 10,000 records including:

x, y: Current coordinates of the vehicle

goal_x, goal_y: Target destination

obstacle_distance & obstacle_angle: Data about nearby obstacles

road_curvature, road_type, lane_position, velocity, step_size

decision_label: Target class label (FORWARD, LEFT, RIGHT, STOP)

ðŸ§  ML Model

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Accuracy: ~97.5%

Feature importance used to optimize performance

Final model saved as .pkl for deployment

ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements

Integrate real-world sensor data (LIDAR, radar)

Extend to RNN/LSTM for sequence-based prediction

Add reinforcement learning for adaptive path control

Real-time integration with vehicle simulation environments
